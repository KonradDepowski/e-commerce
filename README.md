## Project Overview

I developed a fully responsive sneaker shop website using Next.js.
The website incorporates the following features:
* Authentication: Secure user login and management using Clerk.
* Database: Data is stored in a MongoDB database. Next.js server actions are used to fetch and submit data efficiently.
* Product Features: Users can filter and sort products to find sneakers easily.
* Cart and Purchase: Sneakers can be added to a cart and purchased through the Stripe payment flow.
